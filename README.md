# bamazon

This application is created in the purpose of testing MySQL, node and npm. Similar to amazon, we have created bamazon, a store that shows stock items and enables the ability to purchase and restock supply. Bamazon is a command line application, where users can interact with the terminal. The terminal will be connected to an SQL database where all the stock items are listed and contained.
